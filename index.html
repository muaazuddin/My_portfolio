            <h3>Hi there. I'm a freelance Web Developer that specializes in Squarespace. If you want some extra
                customization for your page, or you want someone to set it up the first time, I'm your guy! For the past
                8 months, I've been creating Squarespace sites for businesses of all sizes. No project is too big or too
                small. My specialty is to consult with you to set up and design your page and then train and hand off
                the page for you to continue on your own with minimal help going forward. I'm also available to do
                recurring work updating your page regularly as well as one on one training sessions.</h3>

                <h3>Front-end development is programming done on the front end of a website â€“ the part that people view
                    and interact with. Front-end developers are in charge of the complete user interface as well as the
                    application's aesthetic design. Front-end developers are critical in ensuring that users have a good
                    experience every time they browse a site since websites are more effective when they appear
                    professional and work efficiently. Front-end developers typically employ CSS3, JavaScript, and HTML
                    because these languages are essential for website design. Some of the languages used are mentioned
                    below.</h3>

                <h3> The corporate world can be very daunting or very demanding, especially when you are a fresher. From
                    a
                    comparatively plain sailing journey of a college/university life to a highly competitive working
                    environment, the transition is never easy. Yet I can tell you that getting into the battleground is
                    damn exciting. You get to learn technologies that you might have never heard of, learn stuff from
                    the elites out there and the best of all; you feel important because your code and your effort
                    matters to the company.and HTML because these languages are essential for website design. Some of
                    the languages used are mentioned below.</h3>
